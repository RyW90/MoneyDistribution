# Visualize the money Distribution in a WeChat Group
---

WeChat redpackage is a popular game in China, especially during the Chinese New Year Period. People can only get limited money in this game, but they still feel happy because it also means good fortune.</br>

However, I always confuse about that if we follow the rule as below, what's the money distribution in this gruop. 
>Initially, everyone have the same amount of money, and a menber send a redpackage to others. Then, the one who get the most money in the last turn will send the same amount of money in a redpackage to other. They repeat this cycle.Finally, what's condition will happen? Will everyone still have similar money?

Fortunately, I have solve the problem and visualize the result. You can run this program and see whether it is the same as your conclusion! </br>
